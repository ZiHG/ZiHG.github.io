I graduated from Emory MSBA program (Master of Science in Business Analytics) in May, 2018 and currently working as a business analyst intern. Welcome to my [Github profile](https://github.com/ZiHG) to look at the projects Iâ€™ve done so far. These projects mainly cover: 

+ ***predictive modeling*** (classification, regression), using <span style="color:teal">*R, python and RapidMiner* </span>; 
+ ***social network analysis***, using <span style="color:teal">*R* </span>; 
+ ***data visualization***, using <span style="color:teal">*Tableau and R* </span>;
+ And now I shift my focus to wrestling ***big data*** with <span style="color:teal">*AWS* </span> and tools in <span style="color:teal">*Apache Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, Sqoop, Hive and more)* </span> and report automation.
